      <p>MR. HAINLEY: When you think about putting the show together, I know that a friend of a friend of mine, who was at the show, said the spots you were using to light the Marilyns were very particular –
      MS. STURTEVANT: Spots.
      MR. HAINLEY: – spots.
      MS. STURTEVANT: Yes.
      MR. HAINLEY: And I wondered if you could talk about where in your thinking process the installation fora show comes in to how the show manifests its –
      MS. STURTEVANT: It’s called thinking.</p>

      <p>Elaine Sturtevant left us in 2014. She’s remembered by most for a body of work that among other things, is highly controversial and embroiled in many intensely dense and philosophical conversations surrounding notions of labor, methods of production and arrangement, as they deal with the act of creating and exhibiting artworks.</p>

There are                                                                                                                                                           public perception about Sturtevant’s work revolves around many words that socially and conceptually relate to the concept of “mimesis”2 as introduced by the Greeks. However, also focusing on the concept of “origin”3 may provide a more fruitful framework.</p>

      <p>To speak on mimesis, it’s helpful to refer to an extensive three-hour interview with Bruce Hainley4 and Michael Lobel5 with Sturtevant that took place in 2007. Hainley asks Sturtevant, knowing she was versed in the philosophy of Spinoza and Foucault, if perhaps her work, which on a visual level can be perceived as mimetic, derived from their philosophical writings. Sturtevant denies this by emphasizing that her idea and application of copy came from the Greeks, and perhaps it had originated even before with the suggesting that the theoretical concept of copy, was well established in pre-biblical times.</p>

      <p>If we are to take this statement and consider the work of Johann Joachim Winkelmann, 18th century German art historian and archaeologist who</p>
                                                                                                                                        
      <p>Greek art is the pinnacle of human achievement with everything else being derivative, he still believes in the import this process of derivation has,
      “...what is imitated, if handled with reason, may assume another nature, as it were, and become one’s own.”7 Sturtevant, being 83 at the time of the</p>
