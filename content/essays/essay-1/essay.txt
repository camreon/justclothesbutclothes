        MR. HAINLEY: When you think about putting the show together, I know that a friend of a friend of mine, who was at the show, said the spots you were using to light the Marilyns were very particular –<br>
        MS. STURTEVANT: Spots.<br>
        MR. HAINLEY: – spots.<br>
        MS. STURTEVANT: Yes.<br>
        MR. HAINLEY: And I wondered if you could talk about where in your thinking process the installation fora show comes in to how the show manifests its –<br>
        MS. STURTEVANT: It’s called thinking. [^ Wong, L. (2002): Home away from home? Abingdon: Routledge. Seite 171]

      <p>Elaine Sturtevant left us in 2014. She’s remembered by most for a body of work that among other things, is highly controversial and embroiled in many intensely dense and philosophical conversations surrounding notions of labor, methods of production and arrangement, as they deal with the act of creating and exhibiting artworks.</p>

      <p>In order to speak about Sturtevant and her work in any meaningful way, her specific vocabulary must be de ned unto her, to place us all on a leveled  eld of communiqué. Thus; copy, repeat, repetition, interiority, exteriority, total structure, cybernetics and origin, built upon the philosophical writings to Deleuze and Foucault, with parallel relations to the historiographers Johann Joachim Winkelmann and Aby Warburg will be accounted for. There are also central tenants to the work of Elaine Sturtevant that must be clearly identi ed before one can go any further. As you can see, critical writing and public perception about Sturtevant’s work revolves around many words that socially and conceptually relate to the concept of “mimesis”<sup>2</sup> as introduced by the Greeks. However, also focusing on the concept of “origin”<sup>3</sup> may provide a more fruitful framework.</p>

      <p>To speak on mimesis, it’s helpful to refer to an extensive three-hour interview with Bruce Hainley<sup>4</sup> and Michael Lobel<sup>5</sup> with Sturtevant that took place in 2007. Hainley asks Sturtevant, knowing she was versed in the philosophy of Spinoza and Foucault, if perhaps her work, which on a visual level can be perceived as mimetic, derived from their philosophical writings. Sturtevant denies this by emphasizing that her idea and application of copy came from the Greeks, and perhaps it had originated even before with the suggesting that the theoretical concept of copy, was well established in pre-biblical times.</p>

      <p>“Copy was not always demeaned; copy was, at some point, at a very high level.”<sup>6</sup></p>

      <p>If we are to take this statement and consider the work of Johann Joachim Winkelmann, 18th century German art historian and archaeologist who pioneered the distinctions between Greek, Greco-Roman, and Roman art, we’ll  nd that although he takes the controversial stance that
        Greek art is the pinnacle of human achievement with everything else being derivative, he still believes in the import this process of derivation has,
        handled with reason, may assume another nature, as it were, and become one’s own.”<sup>7</sup> Sturtevant, being 83 at the time of the
        made the type of work in question since 1964, probably found herself explaining for the past 40 years the actuality of her work to many that most assuredly had trouble placing it. Her explanations, as seen at the beginning of the essay, appear curt, but she, along with her work demanded intense intellectual rigor and engagement. Those curt moments appear to be her taking the reigns so as to explain to her audience what the ...</p>
